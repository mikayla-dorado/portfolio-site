//             <p>
//                 My journey into the world of Software Development began in the fall of 2022. 
//                 Growing up in a non-tech-oriented family, I initially perceived the tech/IT industry as something beyond my reach. 
//                 Before embarking on my coding bootcamp journey, I spent nearly three years working at CVS Pharmacy, where I progressed from an Inventory Specialist to a Lead Pharmacy Technician.

//                 Despite my achievements, I knew deep down that this wasn't my long-term path. 
//                 It wasn't until my husband and our friend introduced me to the world of Development that I decided to explore it further. 
//                 Trying it out at home, I quickly discovered a passion for unlocking the ability to create almost anything. 
//                 The prospect of continuously learning new languages, libraries, and frameworks excites me and fuels my anticipation for a future career in this dynamic field.
//             </p>

//                 When I'm not practicing code, I enjoy spending time at home with my husband.
//                 One of our favorite things to do together is order a pizza and play Super Mario Bros on the Wii or our Switch.
//                 Other hobbies of mine include cooking and baking for my loved ones, reading books, and attending church with our family!
